Information
------------
This is a port of Andres0X. These themes were originally designed by Andreas Viklund (andreasviklund.com) as a free website template. He states (http://andreasviklund.com/about/copyright/) "The free website templates (and all included images and related extras) are released as open source web design. It means that you may use the templates for free for any purpose, personal as well as commercial, without any obligations or conditions."

Please do let me know of any bugs or features you would like to see.

Install

Install the theme as you would for any other theme.


FAQ
-----
1. How do I use primary and secondary menus?
A. Some of the sub-themes require you to use primary and secondary menus as blocks.

2.  Can I you add feature xyz?
A.  Yes.  However it depends specifically on the feature and timeframe.  I do not earn any money from this and do it in my spare time.  I attempt to accomodate any changes requested, although this does obviously have to fit in with when I can get the time.
